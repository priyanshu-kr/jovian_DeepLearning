Here, I store my work from the course Deep Learning with PyTorch.
This repository covers the following topics:

1. PyTorch Basics & Tensor Operations
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. Training Deep Neural Networks on a GPU
5. Feedforward Neural Networks
6. Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks
7. Data Augmentation, Regularization
8. 

Project 1 - Flowers Classification Project (Image Processing)

Work under progress..
