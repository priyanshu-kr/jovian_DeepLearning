    "The approach we've taken in this tutorial is very different from programming as you might know it. Usually, we write programs that take some inputs, perform some operations, and return a result. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in this notebook, we've defined a \"model\" that assumes a specific relationship between the inputs and the outputs, expressed using some unknown parameters (weights & biases). We then show the model some know inputs and outputs and _train_ the model to come up with good values for the unknown parameters. Once trained, the model can be used to compute the outputs for new inputs.\n",

    "This paradigm of programming is known as _machine learning_, where we use data to figure out the relationship between inputs and outputs. _Deep learning_ is a branch of machine learning that uses matrix operations, non-linear activation functions and gradient descent to build and train models.
